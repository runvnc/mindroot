Starting MindRoot

LLM Plugin Installation
-----------------------


- Go to the `/admin` page by clicking the Admin link at the top of the home page.

LLM API Key

For this section you will need an API key from an LLM provider.
We will assume OpenRouter for this example.

First, make sure the OpenRouter Plugin is installed:

- Go to the /admin page (Admin link on home page)

- Expand the Advanced section and click on Plugins

- OpenRouter/ah_openrouter should show up

Now, enter your OpenRouter API key:

- Go to Admin | Advanced | Environment Variables

- Find the ah_openrouter section and enter your API key in the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` field and Save.

Finally, restart MindRoot:

- Go to Admin | Server Settings |  Server Control 
- Click on Restart Server
