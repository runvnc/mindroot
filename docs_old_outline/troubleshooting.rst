Troubleshooting
===============

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using AgentHost and their solutions.

Agent Not Starting
-----------------

If your agent fails to start, check the following:

1. Ensure you have the correct permissions to run the agent.
2. Check if all required dependencies are installed.
3. Verify that your configuration file is valid YAML.

Plugin Loading Failures
-----------------------

If a plugin fails to load:

1. Make sure the plugin file is in the correct directory.
2. Check that the plugin class name matches the filename.
3. Verify that the plugin implements all required methods.

Task Execution Issues
---------------------

If tasks are not executing as expected:

1. Check the task schedule configuration.
2. Ensure that the task function is properly decorated with `@agent.task`.
3. Verify that the task doesn't have any unhandled exceptions.

Performance Problems
--------------------

If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Check the system resources (CPU, memory) available to AgentHost.
2. Consider optimizing resource-intensive tasks or plugins.
3. Adjust the concurrency settings if running multiple agents.

Logging and Debugging
---------------------

To get more information about issues:

1. Increase the log level to DEBUG in your configuration.
2. Check the log files for detailed error messages and stack traces.
3. Use the built-in debugging tools or connect a debugger to the AgentHost process.
