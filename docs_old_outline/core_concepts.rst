Core Concepts
==============

This page provides an overview of the core concepts in AgentHost.

Open Registry
-------------

The open registry system is a central component of AgentHost, providing a flexible way to manage and distribute plugins, agents, personas, and potentially models.

Plugins
-------

Plugins extend the functionality of AgentHost, allowing for easy addition of new features, services, or integrations.

Agents and Personas
-------------------

Agents are AI entities with defined capabilities, while personas provide customizable personalities for these agents.

Services and Providers
----------------------

Services power the capabilities of agents, with providers offering both local and remote implementations of these services.

Intelligent Service Management
------------------------------

AgentHost automatically determines and installs required services based on agent definitions, streamlining the setup process.

UI Customization
----------------

The user interface of AgentHost is designed to be easily modifiable through theme overrides and plugin injections.

RAG and Knowledgebases
----------------------

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledgebases are planned features that will enhance the AI capabilities of AgentHost, integrated with the registry system.
