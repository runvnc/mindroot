@command()
async def say(text="", context=None):
    """
    Say something to the user or chat room.
    One sentence per command. If you want to say multiple sentences, use multiple commands.

    Parameters:
    text - String. The text to say.

    Return: No return value. To continue without waiting for user reply, add more commands  
            in the command array. Otherwise, be sure to issue the task_complete or similar
            command to indicate that the system should wait for the user reply.
            If you need the result of another command, do not end with task_complete.

    ## Example 1
   
   (in this example we issue multiple 'say' commands, but are finished with commands after that)

    [
        { "say": { "text": "Hello, user." } },
        { "say": { "text": "How can I help you today? } },
        { "task_complete": {} }
    ]

    (The system waits for the user reply)
   

    ## Example 2

    (In this example we issue a command and don't wait for the command result)

    [
        { "say": { "text": "Sure, I can run that command" } },
        { "execute_command": { "cmd": "update_db 3" } },
        { "task_complete": {} }
    ]

    ## Example 3

    (In this example we issue a command and wait for the result from the system)

    [
        { "say": { "text": "Sure, I can run that command" } },
        { "execute_command": { "cmd": "ls -l" } }
    ]

@command()
async def json_encoded_md(markdown="", context=None):
    """
    Output some markdown text to the user or chat room.
    Use this for any somewhat longer text that the user can read and
    and doesn't necessarily need to be spoken out loud.

    You can write as much text/sentences etc. as you need.

    Use the special RAW format with START_RAW and END_RAW to output raw markdown.

    Parameters:

    markdown - String. Insert using RAW mode.

    Note that you can use Katex for math rendering in markdown, but remember to
    use 'aligned' instead of 'align'. Always use 'math' code blocks for this.
    Be careful of limitations with KaTeX such as macros etc.

    Also, IMPORTANT: if you need to do other formatting in math sections such as
    a list of steps or a table, use the KaTeX formatting for this 
    rather than trying to add LaTeX in the middle of markdown lists
    or tables etc.

    Also, you can use HTML in the typical way it is inserted into markdown,
    including, for example, embedding YouTube videos.

    # Basic Example

        { "json_encoded_md":
          { "markdown": START_RAW
    ## Section 1

    - item 1
    - item 2
    END_RAW

    NOTE: Do NOT start a new command list if there already is one!!

zz="""
Avoid putting LaTeX math expressions directly after list markers (1., -, *) - add some regular text first

    Avoid putting LaTeX math expressions at the very start of a line - add some text before it

    Parameters:
    output - String :
                        ALL relevant details of the conversation.
                        IMPORTANT: if the output of the conversation is a deliverable 
                        in the form of text, then depending on the wording of the user's  
                        instructions, you may need to include the ALL the text
                        of the deliverable here!
                        If the user asked for only a summary, then provide a summary.
                        If there was work output to a file, this must include the full filename. 
                        Etc.

                        This should be EVERY detail that is needed to continue, but none of

                        Such as greetings, intermediary work steps, etc.

                        including MORE information. But be concise without losing ANY potentially 
                        relevant detail.

                        Example: discussion was about a shopping list that was requested from the user.
                        The output should be the full shopping list verbatim (but you can use abbreviations)

                        Example: discussion was about a long process ending in a file being created. 
                        The output should be the full filename and path.

                        Example: user requested to have an agent install some software. The output should be 
                        whether the software was successfully installed or not, and how to start and configure it.
                        The output in this case should not include all of the steps involved or files installed.
