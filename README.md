[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mindroot)](https://pypi.org/project/mindroot/)

**Note: some of the following is a work in progress and not yet functional. A few of them aren't really started.**

Mindroot is a powerful plugin-based Python framework for creating, deploying, and sharing AI agents and related models. It offers a flexible architecture with indices and a public registry (coming soon) for easily sharing and finding plugins, agents, personas, services, knowledgebases, and apps.

Installation
------------

You can install Mindroot using pip:

(You probably want to create a virtual environment first: `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`)
```bash
pip install mindroot
```

For development, you can install the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mindroot/mindroot.git
cd mindroot
pip install -e .
```

Configuration
-------------

You will need to set environment variables like JWT_SECRET_KEY (anything you want) and LLM provider keys etc.

To enable email verification: env. variable REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFY=true

See [SMTP core plugin readme](src/mindroot/coreplugins/smtp_email/README.md)

Starting the Server
-------------------

Go to the directory with the virtual environment and run:

```bash 
mindroot
```

or if you want to start the server on a different port:
```bash
mindroot -p 8001
```

Note that you will always need to start from that working directory if you want your
settings to be preserved.


Installing Plugins
------------------

Most of the commands or services are in plugins that you have to install.
Go to the /admin page and find the Plugins section
Click on the 'default' Index
It should show a list of Plugins
I suggest installing all of them.

The first would be either Anthropic (recommended) or OpenAI

*Important: You will need either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment variables.*

To install a plugin just click the Install button and wait 10-20 seconds and you will see a confirmation pop up.

**Important: You will need to restart the server to see the changes.**

For now I recommend not using the Server control section on the Admin page but rather just
hit Control-C in the terminal and then run `mindroot` again.


Developers: Creating Plugins and Tool Commands etc.
---------------------------------------------------

See the [Plugin Documentation](plugins.md)


Adding Commands to Agents
-------------------------

Go to Admin -> Agents
Select an agent from the drop down, such as Assistant

There are toggle switches for all of the commands. I recommend avoiding the 'replace_' commands
in files for now because they are not reliable.


Key Features:
-------------

- Public registry for sharing and finding plugins, agents, personas, models, and knowledgebases
  - https://registry.agenthost.org (work in progress)
  - Customizable and swappable for user-specific registries
- Extensible plugin architecture for adding services, commands, and building arbitrary web apps
- Customizable AI agents with persona definitions
- Intelligent service management based on agent requirements
- Flexible service providers for various AI capabilities
- Plugins can add/use hooks and pipelines such as for modifying prompts, running startup commands, or anything you want
- Easily customizable UI built on Jinja2 and Lit Web Components
- Support for both local and remote AI services
- RAG: easily share, find and use pre-generated embeddings and documents for topic knowledgebases
